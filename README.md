Game Name: Bunny Boy \
\
Intent: Simple platformer, not really any bells or whistles \
\
Narrative: Help a father rabbit find his children who have been scattered throughout the forest! \
\
Mechanics: Move left, right, and jump. Collect carrots to double jump. Carrot respawn after a time. \
\
Aesthetics: Warm colors, bouncy music, and high pitch sound effects make for a cute and charming experience \
\
Joys: I (Eden) really liked making music with vocals for the game. Additionally, the parallax was very satisfying once I got it working. I (Jake) enjoyed tinkering with level design and coming up with interesting ways to play!\
\
Struggles: My partner and I were strapped for time for much of the process, and thus we had to submit late. We ran into a few bugs concerning our player movement which were difficult to handle as well. \

I created the level design for the game, as well as worked on programming code for the game, especially player movement.
