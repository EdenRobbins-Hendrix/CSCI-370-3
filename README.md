Game Name: Bunny Boy \
\
Intent: Simple platformer, not really any bells or whistles \
\
Narrative: Help a father rabbit find his children who have been scattered throughout the forest! \
\
Mechanics: Move left, right, and jump. Collect carrots to double jump. Carrot respawn after a time. \
\
Aesthetics: Warm colors, bouncy music, and high pitch sound effects make for a cute and charming experience \
\
Joys: I (Eden) really liked making music with vocals for the game. Additionally, the parallax was very satisfying once I got it working. \
\
Struggles: My partner and I were strapped for time for much of the process, and thus we had to submit late. \

I created custom music for the game, as well as sourced and added in the sprites (I made a few custom ones as well), backgrounds, and sfx. Most of the game's code was made by me.
